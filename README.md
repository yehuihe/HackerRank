# HackerRank

Hi All,

My HackerRank solutions. I believe these are generally efficient and concise solutions. I tend to write mean logic in algorithmic way rather than clever one liners.
And I follow very PEP-8 rigorously.

By the way. The code here can't run in local environment due to it's the code for HackerRank's environment. Just comment out environment code and print <b>result</b> for local run.
